# Introduction

[Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal) is a Workflow-as-Code platform for building and operating
resilient applications using developer-friendly primitives, instead of constantly fighting your infrastructure.

The Clojure SDK is the framework for authoring Workflows and Activities in Clojure. (For other languages, see [Temporal SDKs](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development).)
