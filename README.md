# Temporal Clojure SDK 

[Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal) is a Workflow-as-Code platform for building and operating
resilient applications using developer-friendly primitives, instead of constantly fighting your infrastructure.

This Clojure SDK is a framework for authoring Workflows and Activities in Clojure. (For other languages, see [Temporal SDKs](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development).)

- [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/devtools/tctl/)

## Requirements

- JDK 1.8+

## macOS Users

Due to issues with default hostname resolution
(see [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33289695/inetaddress-getlocalhost-slow-to-run-30-seconds) for more details),
macOS Users may see gRPC `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` errors and other slowdowns when running the SDK.

To solve the problem add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file (where my-macbook is your hostname):

```conf
127.0.0.1   my-macbook
::1         my-macbook
```
