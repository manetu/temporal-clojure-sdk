(defn create-client
  "
Creates a new client instance suitable for implementing Temporal workers (See [[temporal.client.worker/start]]) or
workflow clients (See [[create-workflow]]).

Arguments:

- `options`: Client configuration option map (See below)
- `timeout`: Connection timeout as a [Duration](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api//java/time/Duration.html) (default: 5s)
