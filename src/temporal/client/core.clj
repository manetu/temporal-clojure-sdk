Creates a new client instance suitable for implementing Temporal workers (See [[temporal.client.worker/start]]) or
workflow clients (See [[create-workflow]]).

Arguments:

- `options`: Options for configuring the `WorkflowClient` (See [[temporal.client.options/workflow-client-options]] and [[temporal.client.options/stub-options]])
- `timeout`: Connection timeout as a [Duration](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api//java/time/Duration.html) (default: 5s)

(defn create-workflow
  "
Create a new workflow-stub instance, suitable for managing and interacting with a workflow through it's lifecycle.

*N.B.: The workflow will remain in an uninitialized and idle state until explicitly started with either ([[start]]) or
([[signal-with-start]]).*

```clojure
(defworkflow my-workflow
  [ctx args]
  ...)

Sends 'params' as a signal 'signal-name' to 'workflow'

(defn get-result
  "
Retrieves the final result of 'workflow'.  Returns a promise that when derefed will resolve to the evaluation of the
defworkflow once the workflow concludes.

```clojure
(defworkflow my-workflow

  ...)

(let [w (create ...)]

(defn query
  "
Sends query with 'query-type' and 'args' to 'workflow', returns a value.
The query result is computed by a query-handler, registered inside the workflow definition
using [[temporal.workflow/register-query-handler!]].

Arguments:
- `query-type`: keyword (or coerceable into a keyword)
- `args`: serializable query params

```clojure

  "
Gracefully cancels 'workflow'

  "
Forcefully terminates 'workflow'
