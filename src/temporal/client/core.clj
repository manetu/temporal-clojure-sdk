Create a new workflow-stub instance, suitable for managing and interacting with a workflow through it's lifecycle.

*N.B.: The workflow will remain in an uninitialized and idle state until explicitly started with either ([[start]]) or
([[signal-with-start]]).*

Sends 'params' as a signal 'signal-name' to 'workflow'

  "
Retrieves the final result of 'workflow'.  Returns a promise that when derefed will resolve to the evaluation of the
defworkflow once the workflow concludes.

(let [w (create ...)]

Gracefully cancels 'workflow'

Forcefully terminates 'workflow'
