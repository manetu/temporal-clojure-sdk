(defn start
  "
Starts a Temporal worker associated with the mock environment created with [[create]].

Arguments:

  - `options`:  See [[temporal.client.worker/worker-options]]

```clojure
(let [env (create)]
  (start env {:task-queue ::my-queue :ctx {:some \"context\"}})
  ;; create and invoke workflows
  (stop env))

    :ok))

(defn stop
  "
Stops the test environment created by [[create]].  Does not wait for shutdown to complete.  For coordinated shutdown,
see [[synchronized-stop]].

```clojure
(stop instance)
```
"
  [^TestWorkflowEnvironment env]
  (.shutdown env))

(defn synchronized-stop
  "
Stops the test environment created by [[create]].  Blocks until the environment has shut down.  For async termination,
see [[stop]]

```clojure
(synchronized-stop instance)
```
"
  [^TestWorkflowEnvironment env]
  (.close env))

  "Returns a client instance associated with the mock environment created by [[create]]"
