(defn register-query-handler!
  "
Registers a DynamicQueryHandler listener that handles queries sent to the workflow, using [[temporal.client.core/query]].

Use inside a workflow definition with 'f' closing over the workflow state (e.g. atom) and
evaluating to results in function of the workflow state and its 'query-type' and 'args' arguments.

Arguments:
- `f`: a 2-arity function, expecting 2 arguments, evaluating to something serializable.

`f` arguments:
- `query-type`: keyword
- `args`: params value or data structure

```clojure
(defworkflow stateful-workflow
  [{:keys [init] :as args}]
  (let [state (atom init)]
    (register-query-handler! (fn [query-type args]
                               (when (= query-type :my-query)
                                 (get-in @state [:path :to :answer]))))
    ;; workflow implementation
    ))

(defmacro defworkflow
  "
Defines a new workflow, similar to defn, expecting a 1-arity parameter list and body.  Should evaluate to something
serializable, which will become available for [[temporal.client.core/get-result]].

Arguments:

- `args`: Passed from 'params' to [[temporal.client.core/start]] or [[temporal.client.core/signal-with-start]]

```clojure
(defworkflow my-workflow
    [{:keys [foo]}]
    ...)

(let [w (create-workflow client my-workflow {:task-queue ::my-task-queue})]
   (start w {:foo \"bar\"}))

               (f# args#))))))))

(defn invoke
  "
Invokes a 'child workflow' with 'params' from within a workflow context.
Returns a promise that when derefed will resolve to the evaluation of the defworkflow once the workflow concludes.

Arguments:

- `workflow`: A reference to a symbol registered with [[defworkflow]], called a Child Workflow usually.
- `params`: Opaque serializable data that will be passed as arguments to the invoked child workflow
- `options`: See below.
